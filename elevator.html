    <h2>My Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is <strong>Oluwatobi Abass</strong>.  
      I’m currently training in <strong>data science</strong> through the ALX program while building hands-on 
      experience in <strong>cloud engineering</strong>, especially managing Windows environments on AWS.  
      I also have a growing interest in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, where I’ve been exploring threat detection, 
      ethical hacking, and system hardening.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m developing strong skills in <strong>data interpretation and visualization</strong>, 
      <strong>secure cloud infrastructure deployment</strong>, and <strong>network monitoring</strong>.  
      What makes me stand out is my adaptability and problem-solving mindset.  
      I’ve handled real deployments, troubleshooted complex setups, and I constantly challenge myself 
      to grow—whether it’s through scripting in PowerShell or analyzing data to draw insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring value by bridging the gap between cloud engineering, data, and security.  
      Whether it’s helping a company deploy secure infrastructure, analyze system performance, 
      or troubleshoot network issues, I’m ready to add impact where it matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m looking for a <strong>full-time role or internship</strong> in cloud, data, or cybersecurity, 
      where I can contribute and grow with a forward-thinking team.  
      Let’s connect here at ALX and explore how I can help you build secure, data-driven digital solutions.
    </p>
