      <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I have experienced moments of <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>—times when, despite my achievements,
        I questioned whether I was doing enough. When others praise my technical abilities, I remind myself that
        progress doesn’t always look like perfection, and every milestone counts.
      </p>

      <h3>Reframing Negative Self-Talk</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Negative Thought:</strong> “I should know more by now—I’m behind.”</li>
        <li><strong>Flipped Thought:</strong> “I’m investing consistently in my growth. My discipline and curiosity are leading me forward.”</li>
      </ul>
