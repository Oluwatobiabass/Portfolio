      I have deployed and managed Windows instances on AWS EC2, configured and troubleshooted RDP connections, and successfully run Windows-only applications on Linux-hosted cloud environments. 
      I have completed advanced data interpretation projects that provided actionable insights in real-time and gained hands-on experience in secure system administration using PowerShell and DNS configuration. 
      These experiences give me the confidence and technical foundation to pursue larger and more impactful opportunities in technology.

      I now see every step forward, no matter how small, as part of the bigger picture of success.
