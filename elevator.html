    <h2>My Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Toby Sam</span>.  
      I’m currently advancing my expertise in <span class="highlight">data science</span> through the ALX program 
      while gaining <span class="highlight">hands-on experience in cloud engineering</span>, particularly managing 
      Windows environments on AWS. I also have a growing focus on <span class="highlight">cybersecurity</span>, 
      exploring threat detection, ethical hacking, and system hardening.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have strong skills in <span class="highlight">data interpretation and visualization</span>, 
      <span class="highlight">secure cloud infrastructure deployment</span>, and <span class="highlight">network monitoring</span>.  
      What sets me apart is my adaptability and problem-solving mindset—I’ve successfully handled 
      real-world deployments, troubleshooted complex setups, and constantly challenge myself to grow, 
      whether through scripting in PowerShell or analyzing data for actionable insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring value as a professional who can bridge the gap between 
      <span class="highlight">cloud engineering, data, and security</span>.  
      Whether it’s deploying secure infrastructure, optimizing system performance, 
      or solving network challenges, I’m ready to make a measurable impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m seeking a <span class="highlight">full-time role or internship</span> in cloud, data, or cybersecurity, 
      where I can contribute to innovative projects and grow with a forward-thinking team.  
      <strong>I’d be excited to bring my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to create solutions 
      that empower your business.</strong>
    </p>
