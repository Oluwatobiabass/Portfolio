    <h2>My Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is <strong>Oluwatobi Abass</strong>.<br>
      I’m currently training in <strong>data science</strong> through the ALX program while gaining hands-on 
      experience in <strong>cloud engineering</strong>, particularly in managing Windows environments on AWS. 
      I also have a growing passion for <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, where I’m exploring threat detection, 
      ethical hacking, and system hardening.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring strong skills in <strong>data interpretation and visualization</strong>, 
      <strong>secure cloud infrastructure deployment</strong>, and <strong>network monitoring</strong>. 
      My adaptability and problem-solving mindset set me apart—I’ve successfully managed real deployments, 
      troubleshooted complex setups, and constantly push myself to grow, whether through scripting in PowerShell 
      or uncovering insights from data.
    </p>

    <p>
      I create value by bridging the gap between <strong>cloud engineering, data, and security</strong>. 
      Whether it’s deploying secure infrastructure, analyzing system performance, or solving network challenges, 
      I’m ready to deliver impact where it matters most.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m seeking a <strong>full-time role or internship</strong> in cloud, data, or cybersecurity, 
      where I can contribute and grow alongside a forward-thinking team.  
      <strong>Let’s connect and explore how I can help you build secure, data-driven digital solutions.</strong>
    </p>
